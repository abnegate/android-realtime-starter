# Appwrite Android Realtime üîÅ

A simple way to explore the Appwrite Realtime API & Appwrite Android SDK, using the new `Realtime.kt` service.

## Get Started

The `/app/src/main/java/io/appwrite/realtimestarter/RealtimeViewModel.kt` file contains the **realtime subscription** code, as well as a demo of inserting into the database while listening for realtime updates.

You can learn how to integrate your Appwrite Android SDK in your project and see different features of the SDK that can be used.

This demo doesn't adhere to best practices but rather intended to show a simple example of using Appwrite Realtime API in your android app.
